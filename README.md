### Abstract

Thyroid disease is a prevalent endocrine disorder, necessitating accurate and timely diagnosis to ensure effective treatment and management. This study proposes a novel machine learning framework for thyroid disease prediction by integrating chi-square feature selection, oversampling techniques, and Random Forest (RF) algorithms. The proposed approach aims to enhance predictive accuracy and address class imbalance in thyroid disease datasets.

Firstly, chi-square feature selection is employed to identify the most relevant features, reducing dimensionality and improving the model's interpretability. This step ensures that the selected features significantly contribute to the prediction of thyroid conditions.

Secondly, to mitigate the common issue of class imbalance in medical datasets, oversampling methods such as Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) are utilized. This process generates synthetic instances for the minority class, balancing the class distribution and enabling the model to learn more effectively from underrepresented cases.

Finally, the Random Forest algorithm, known for its robustness and ability to handle complex datasets, is applied for the classification task. The ensemble nature of Random Forest, which builds multiple decision trees and aggregates their predictions, enhances the model's generalization capability and reduces overfitting.

Experimental results on benchmark thyroid datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework. The combination of chi-square feature selection, oversampling, and Random Forest algorithm significantly improves the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of thyroid disease prediction. This approach not only offers a reliable diagnostic tool for healthcare professionals but also contributes to the advancement of machine learning applications in medical diagnosis.
